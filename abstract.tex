A search is conducted for exotic decays of the Standard Model Higgs Boson, $H$, decaying to a pair of pseudoscalars, $a$, which then decay to a pair of muons and tau leptons. Pseudoscalar masses between 15 and 60 GeV are investigated using the full Run II dataset, corresponding to 137 $\text{fb}^{-1}$. Motivation for the existence of the pseudoscalar Higgs is primarily supported by Beyond Standard Model (BSM) Two Higgs Doublet Models with the extension of a Singlet (2HDM+S) - which include the Next to Minimal Super Symmetric Model (NMSSM). Upper limits on the branching fraction are set.
