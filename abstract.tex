A search is conducted for exotic decays of the Standard Model Higgs Boson, $H$, decaying to a pair of pseudoscalars, $a$, which then decay to pairs of muons and tau leptons. Pseudoscalar masses between 20 and 60 GeV are investigated using the full Run II dataset, corresponding to a luminosity of 137 $\text{fb}^{-1}$. The existence of the pseudoscalar Higgs is primarily motivated by Two Higgs Doublet Models with the extension of a Singlet (2HDM+S). Upper limits on the branching fraction are set.
