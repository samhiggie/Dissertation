Before a presentation of the expected limits on the branching fractions is given, a view of the uncertainty model is discussed here. 
In order to measure the systematic effects on the final distributions and the fits, changes in the fit templates are done and propigated to the fit model in the form of rate parameters. This is the accepted method to measure systematic impacts with a parametric fit model. These rate parameters differ slightly between the signal and background distributions. 
For background the error in the fit parameters are directly included in the uncertainty model. 

For the signal, the uncertainty on the spline function is considered. As mentioned in the fit model section and shown in firgure \ref{fig:spline_2016_mmmt}, the magnitude of this uncertainty is estimated from the fit of the parameters for the spline. Overall a 10\% uncertainty is used for the lorenztian (alpha) and 20\% for the standard deviation (sigma) and 0.5\% for the mean (mean). Although the mean is measured very precisely, the energy scale shifts from the leptons are included in this figure. Please look back at the section highlighting the uncertainties to see the bin-shift from the energy scale. The bin-shift indicates the amount the mean of the distriubiton is effected from the energy scale shift.  


For the other systematic uncertainties that are not based on parametric shapes, like the energy scale of the leptons, a log-normal deviation to the normalization is considered. 
In order to read the impact plots, in order to understand the impacts place look at table \ref{tab:impact_guide}:

Systematic pull distributions for the magnitude of the expected uncertainty from each source is listed in figure \ref{fig:impacts_2017_mmmt}. The rest of the channels and years are located in the appendix \ref{app:sysunc}.
