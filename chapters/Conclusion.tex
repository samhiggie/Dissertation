Pre-unblinding summary, final conclusion will be made after unblinding and observed results are obtained: \\



An overview of the Large Hadron Collider, CERN, CMS, luminosity operations, and an analysis focusing on the search for a BSM processes involving an exotic Higgs-like particle was presented.
Using the full Run II dataset collected at CMS corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $\text{137}\text{fb}^{-1}$, the search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson, $H$, decaying to a pair of pseudoscalars, $a$, which then decay to pairs of muons and tau leptons was completed. 

Expected upper 95\% confidence level limits are about $10^{-4}$ after addition of all final decay modes. 


No excess was observed and furthermore the most stringent limits have been set for these decay modes. 


These results are independent of separate 2HDMs and is considered a generic search that applies to multiple MSSM scenarios along with any BSM physics within the search window. 

It has been an honor of a lifetime to work alongside CMS, Purdue, and Princeton Univsersity to deliever this analysis and years of service work!
